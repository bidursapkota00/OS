## Introduction

**Operating System**

- OS is software that manages the computer hardware as well as providing an environment for application programs to run.
- Provides abstraction, simple interface to complex hardware. (OS as extension machine / abstraction provider)
- Allocates processors, memories, and I/O devices among various programs. (OS as resource manager)

**Shell**

- Provides Text Interface
- Translates commands into a form that kernel can understand

**Kernel**

- Core component of OS that coordinates necessary resources & performs requested operations.

---

**Evolution of OS**

**First Generation**

- Physically wired programs, no OS

**Second Generation**

- Batch Processing OS

**Third Generation**

- Multiprogramming OS, Time Sharing OS

**Fourth Generation**

- GUI based OS, Bundled for many PC hardware

**Fifth Generation**

- OS for handheld Phones

---

**Types of OS**

**Batch OS**

- handles groups of similar, repetitive jobs

**Multi-Programming OS**

- Multiple programs stay in memory, and the CPU switches to another program whenever one performs I/O.

**Multi-Tasking OS**

- CPU executes multiple tasks by switching between them.

**Multi-Processing OS**

- More than one processor executing multiple processes parallelly

**Distributed OS**

- Multiple computers communicate over a network to function as a single system, enhancing scalability and reliability.

**Real-Time OS**

- Designed for processing task with time constraints

**OS components**

**Process Management System**

- creating, deleting, pausing, resuming, scheduling, and coordinating processes and their resources.

**Memory Management System**

- allocating memory, managing virtual memory, and moving data between RAM and disk

**Secondary Storage Management**

- allocating space, reclaiming space, avoiding fragmentation, assigning storage to files, and scheduling disk operations

**File Management System**

- organizing files in directories, managing paths and logical blocks, and creating, deleting, opening, reading, and writing files

**I/O System**

- handling I/O requests, using device drivers, managing buffers, and supporting busy waiting, interrupts, and DMA

**Protection and Security System**

- controlling access to resources, enforcing permissions, isolating processes, and preventing unauthorized use
